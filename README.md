# HTTPLoadTesterGUI
I'm not a big fan of the command line for a tool as complicated as the HTTPLoadTester, so I thought it might be nice to build GUI for it. 

Functionality provided:
1) Launching the Recorder Proxy
2) Launching the Load Tester
3) Monitoring Load Tester Statistics
4) Editing Test Plan Files
