# HTTPLoadTesterGUI <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/644c49a8-3ab7-4e67-ad70-4e66aa805235" height="35"/>

I'm not a big fan of the command line for a tool as complicated as the HTTPLoadTester, so I thought it might be nice to build GUI for it. 

Functionality provided:
1) Launching the Recorder Proxy
2) Launching the Load Tester
3) Monitoring Load Tester Statistics
4) Editing Test Plan Files
